### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Michael! A perfectionist PHP programmer currently working full-time at **R2H**. In my spare time I build tools and platforms for my own company **Snoeren Development**.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in optimizing applications, Laravel, PWA's in Vue and hosting on AWS.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building fast offline-capable PWA's!
